LESSON: 6
NAME: Functions
TITLE: What a Function Is
DESC: Functions are an essential building block to most programming.
Functions are basically very small, typically single-purpose, programs that developers can create and use to perform procedures or methods without having to rewrite the code that the function contains, each time they use it.
TITLE: Creating vs Using Functions
DESC: Functions can both be created and used by programmers
When creating a function, a programmer must first define what it is (name and procedure it will perform) and what it needs (input/arguments/operands). After defining what a function needs and what it does with what it is given, it can be callled upon to perform its task anytime needed so long it is given the proper input.
TITLE: The Importance of Return Statements
DESC: Input and procedures to perform are not enough for a function to be useful.
As well as needing arguments to perform its task, a function also needs a return statement in order to make its work have any result and to make its existance worthwhile. A function can perform a procedure perfectly, but without a return statement to give the output of its work, it will never have an effect on what it was called upon do.
