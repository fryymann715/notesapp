# notesApp
This was my ongoing project throughout my Intro to Programming Nanodegree with Udacity. I essentially took notes on the lessons and put my lessons into a web page. The further into the nanodegree I got, the more sophisticated my webpage became, eventually becoming a full webapp utilizing a datastore and a template engine. Also has some javascript for cetain interactions on the page and a repsonive css layout, which alters iteslf based on the size of the screen of the device it is being viewed on.

The back end is written in Python using Jinja2 for its template engine and the google datastore for the database. 
The webapp itself is hosted on the google app engine at: http://deft-idiom-105001.appspot.com/

This project was done before I learned how to use git.
